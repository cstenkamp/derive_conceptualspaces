### Set up development-environment

As I have some Jupyter-Notebooks in here, I am using `nbstripoutput` which ensures the outputs are not commited to Github (except for cells with the `keep_output` tag), and `nbdime` which allows for a nice `diff`-view for notebooks (also allowing for `nbdiff-web`)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
nbstripout --install --attributes .gitattributes
nbdime config-git --enable --global
```

### Set up Sacred

See https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#docker-setup for the easiest way to get the MongoDB and boards to run. The */docker*-directory here is a clone of the respective *examples*-directory from the sacred-repo. To have the same `.env`-file in your local files, I can recommend PyCharm's **EnvFile**-Plugin.
